# LiveProjectPython

This file contains the app I worked on during the two week sprint for the Python Live Project organized by The Tech Academy. It's meant to be a collective of Post different pet owners have made and how they rate if for said pet.

Created 3 forms with a many to many relationship, with the corresponding models. Created function for getting user posts, creating user posts, editing users posts, looking at more detailed information about users posts, and editing the users posts (including deleting the post/saving). Created proper links for buttons throughout PerfectWalk app.
